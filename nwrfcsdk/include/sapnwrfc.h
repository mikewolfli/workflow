	 * - 0: Off. Only severe errors are logged to the dev_rfc.trc file.
	 * - 1: Brief. All API calls (except for the setter and getter functions) and important attributes
	 *      like codepages, RFC headers, logon parameters are traced. Trace is written to a file named
	 *      rfc&lt;pid&gt;.trc or rfc&lt;pid&gt;_&lt;tid&gt;.trc, depending on whether tracing is done
	 *      on a "per-process" basis or a "per-thread" basis. &lt;pid&gt; is the current process ID,
	 *      &lt;tid&gt; the current thread ID.
	 * - 2: Verbose. In addition to 1, the values of the "scalar" RFC parameters as well as the contents
	 *      of the network containers are traced. Scalar parameters are primitive types (CHAR, INT, FLOAT, etc)
	 *      and flat structures.
	 * - 3: Full. In addition to 2 the contents of nested structures and tables as well as all API calls
	 *      of setter and getter functions are traced.
	 * \out *errorInfo Detail information in case the specified connection or destination does not exist.
	 * \return RFC_OK, RFC_INVALID_HANDLE or RFC_INVALID_PARAMETER

	 * - By setting the parameter RFC_TRACE=[0|1|2|3] in the DEFAULT section of the sapnwrfc.ini file.
	 *   This value applies to all destinations, for which no explicit trace level has been set.
	 *   ("Global" trace level.)
	 * - By setting the parameter TRACE=[0|1|2|3] in a specific destination section of sapnwrfc.ini.
	 *   it applies to that destination only and overrules the "global" trace level from the DEFAULT section.
	 * - By setting the environment variable RFC_TRACE=[0|1|2|3]. This overrules the setting from the
	 *   DEFAULT section of sapnwrfc.ini.
	 * - Via %RfcSetTraceLevel(). If connection and destination are NULL, this function sets the global
	 *   trace level and overrules the value from the DEFAULT section of sapnwrfc.ini as well as the environment
	 *   variable RFC_TRACE. If connection is non-NULL, it sets the trace level for the current connection only,
	 *   and if destination is non-NULL, it sets the trace level for that destination, overruling the value from
	 *   this destination's section in the sapnwrfc.ini file.
	 * - By passing a {name=TRACE, value=[0|1|2|3]} pair in the RFC_CONNECTION_PARAMETER array used in
	 *   RfcOpenConnection(), RfcRegisterServer() or RfcStartServer(). If that RFC_CONNECTION_PARAMETER array
	 *   also contains a {name=DEST, value=...} pair, the trace parameter from the array overrules the value
	 *   from this destination's sapnwrfc.ini section.
	 * - In case the program is a server program: by activating the trace flag for the corresponding destination
	 *   in SM59. The trace setting on backend side is then "inherited" by the external side.
	 *
	 * \note For more information on trace settings see the sample sapnwrfc.ini file contained in the demo folder.

	 * \ingroup connection
	 *
	 * This API needs to be called, if the server program is to be started by the R/3 application server.
	 * (RFC destination in SM59 of type "T" in startup mode.)
	 * argc and argv are the inputs of the mainU function. The R/3 application server passes the correct command line to
	 * the program, when starting it up, so you only need to forward these two parameters to %RfcStartServer().
	 * connectionParams is optional and is only needed, if you want to add additional logon parameters to the
	 * ones coming from the command line, e.g for activating trace.
	 *
	 * Like RfcRegisterServer(), the function returns a server connection handle that can be used in RfcListenAndDispatch().
	 * The mechanism of this kind of RFC destination thus works as follows:
	 * -# The R/3 application server opens a telnet connection to the host, where your server program is located, and
	 *    starts the program with the necessary logon parameters. (Or creates a child process, if the startup
	 *    method is "Start on application server".)
	 * -# Your server program calls RfcStartServer, which opens an RFC connection back to the R/3 system.
	 * -# The R/3 system then makes the function call over that RFC connection.
	 *
	 * The main differences of "startup mode" compared to the "registration mode" are:
	 * - Advantage: no logon parameters need to be maintained in the server program. (Unless you want to open
	 *   an additional client connection for looking up function module metadata (RFC_FUNCTION_DESC_HANDLEs) in the
	 *   R/3 DDIC.) 
	 * - Disadvantage: every single function call creates a new process and a telnet connection in addition to
	 *   the actual RFC connection.
	 *

	 * \in argc From mainU() (command line supplied by backend)

	 *
	 * If a callback function has been found, the RFC call will be dispatched to that function for processing,
	 * and %RfcListenAndDispatch() returns the return code of the callback function.
	 * Otherwise %RfcListenAndDispatch() returns a SYSTEM_FAILURE to the R/3 backend and the return code
	 * RFC_NOT_FOUND to the caller.
	 *
	 * In general the return codes of %RfcListenAndDispatch() have the following meaning:
	 * - RFC_OK\n		A function call was processed successfully.
	 * - RFC_RETRY\n	No function call came in within the specified timeout period. ("timeout" is given in seconds.)

	 *				The message parameters have been returned to the backend (and can be evaluated there via
	 *				the sy-msgid, sy-msgtype, sy-msgno, sy-msgv1, ..., sy-msgv4 parameters).
	 * - RFC_EXTERNAL_FAILURE\n	A function call was started to be processed, but was aborted with a "SYSTEM_FAILURE",
	 *				which has been returned to the backend.
	 * - RFC_COMMUNICATION_FAILURE\n	The connection broke down while processing the function call. No response

	 * - RFC_CLOSED\n	The connection has been closed by the backend side (SMGW, SM04). No response

	 * - RFC_NOT_FOUND\n	No handler has been found for the current function module name. A SYSTEM_FAILURE has

	 *
	 * In these five cases the connection has been closed, so the "rfcHandle" needs to be refreshed via RfcRegisterServer.
